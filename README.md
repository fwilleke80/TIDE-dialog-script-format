## “Ride the TIDE — simple scripts for complex talks.”

_TIDE_ is a lightweight, human-readable format for writing branching conversations.

It was developed for _The Sardine Identity_ but is flexible enough for any adventure game.

_TIDE_ scripts use simple blocks and commands to encode dialog, narration, conditions, and options - making it easy to draft, read, and expand dialog trees without engine-specific tools.

This document proposes and defines a format to write the game's dialogs in. That way, the dialogs can be written not unlike in a screenplay, but still offer a tree-like structure.
